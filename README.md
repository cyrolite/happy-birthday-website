# Happy Birthday Jenna! ðŸŽŠ
It's a birthday website for somebody special.

This is very much worth the time and the effort!

I really do hope you appreciate it ðŸ˜„. (AND I HOPE THIS IS SATISFACTORY)

Current Website can be found [here](https://happy-birthday-website-jh0jnitn4-cyrolites-projects.vercel.app).

## Inspiration

This project was started on 16 Mar 2025, when I was lying in my bed (thinking of what to do next).

I was thinking of what to do (amidst drowning in school projects as well as homework)... that's when I realised that I could embark myself on a humble project.

But who can I offer this to? That's when I thought of you! ðŸ˜„

## Early Iterations (Technical)

During the early iterations of development, as a novice web developer, I attempted to self-teach myself the basic CSS / HTML commands.

I also self-taught myself on web deployment using Vercel, and learnt about json packages, as well as HTML / CSS formatting.
